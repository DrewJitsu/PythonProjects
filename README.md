# PythonProjects
A collection of school and personal projects written in Python

Brief Description of Each:

**NumberGuess.py**
The program simulates a number guessing game between computer and user:

The computer is the one "thinking" about the number. The number will be any integer between 1 and 100. (number assigned)
The program asks the user to enter their name and greets them.
The user is then prompted to guess the number and the program will read that user input.
As long as the user does not guess the number, they will be allowed to guess again until they do
For each guess, the user will be told if their guess was too high or too low. Once the user guesses correctly, they are congratulated and a message is displayed to let them know how many attempts it took them to guess correctly.

**ComplexFileHandling**
This program reads a CSV file and uses it to create an Excel file that shows the same information but also displays a histogram of the information. 

**Graphing.py**
This program takes data from a published site and builds a graph based on it.  

**Process_Plot_CSV.py**
This program processes an existing data file. It adds a line to the CSV which contains first name, last name, age, Information Science, 100, and todayâ€™s date. It then creates a plot from the file (after adding the name). Which requires converting the .csv file to an excel file.

**KeyLog.py**
This program logs keystrokes and appends them to a CSV file. 

**SimpleNumberGuess.py**
This is another Number Guessing game created for the purpose of practicing iteration and creating functions.
