# PythonProjects
A collection of school and personal projects written in Python

Brief Description of Each:

**NumberGuess.py**
The program will try to simulate a number guessing game between the computer and the user:

The computer is the one "thinking" about the number. This number will be any integer between 1 and 100. At this stage in the course, you as the program will create a variable and assign it a value between 1 and 100.
The program will ask the user to enter their name and greet them.
The user will be prompted to guess the number and the program will read that user input.
As long as the user does not guess the number, they will be allowed to guess again until they do
For each guess, the user will be told if their guess was too high or too low. Once the user guesses correctly, they should be congratulated and a message should be displayed to let them know how many attempts they needed to guess correctly.

**Graphing.py**
This program takes data from a published site and builds a graph based on it. 

**Process_Plot_CSV.py**
This program processes an existing data file. It addsa a line to the CSV which contains first name, last name, age, Information Science, 100, and todayâ€™s date. It then creates a plot from the file (after adding the name). Which requires converting the .csv file to an excel file.

**KeyLog.py**
This program logs keystrokes and appends them to a CSV file.
